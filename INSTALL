There is still no installer for EasyVZ, but it is fairly straight forward 
to setup. You can copy the source anywhere you want on your machine.

Pre-requesites:
---------------
1. openVZ enabled kernel
2. All the openVZ utilities need to be installed
3. If you want to create new VPSes, you need to have template caches
   installed in /vz/template/cache

In short, it must be a working openVZ system, on which you must be able 
to manually create, delete or manage VPSes.

Running the server
------------------
The source distribution contains two directories, one is named "backend" and 
the other "gui". The "backend" directory contains the server source code.
To run the server, become root and run start the server

# cd backend/
# python server.py

This will start the server. Please note that the server needs to be started
on the openVZ node that you intend to manage. The client can run on any
system that can reach the server over the network. The server uses port 8086.

Warning: In the current version of the software, there is no authentication,
anyone who can run the client can manage the server. Please exercise caution.

Running the client
------------------
The client can be run on the same machine as the server or on another machine
that can reach the server over a network. The client must be run as a normal
user, not root. Running the client is very simple:

$ cd gui/
$ python ezvz.py

This will bring up the server IP/port dialog box, you can figure it out from 
here, I guess.

Thankyou for your interest in EasyVZ.
